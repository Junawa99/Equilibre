For the layout and structure of the website we took some ideas and inspiration from the website of N.A.E, because we personally like their brand and what they offer, which is also skin-care products.</p>

	   <p class="paragraph2">We did our testing with 15 people. We first showed the people 2 pages of the paper prototype of the website-the home page and the about page. We did that by creating a survey, putting the pages there and asking the people if they think the website will look visually appealing and if the layout is likable and simple, because this was our goal. All of the 15 people find the paper prototypes likable and said thatit has a clear and simple style that fits our brand's image.<br>After we were done with the website we showed it to the same 15 people by again creating a survey and asking them 6 questions:<br>
	      <strong>1. Do they find the content of the pages interesting and reletaing to the brand.</strong><br>
		  <strong>2. Are the visuals appealing and matching with the aesthetic of the website.</strong><br><strong>3. Is the website easy to navigate.</strong><br><strong>4. What they think of the position of the different elements of the website and the layout.</strong><br><strong>5. Are there any useability issues they found.</strong><br><strong>6.What kind recommendations of improvment they would do.</strong><br><br>The outcome of the user testing is that there were some issues with the responity of the website if you open it via a mobile phone, but we fixed that. The recommendations we got are that the layout, the structure, the visuals were very liked, but some of the participants said that we should elaborate more on the content, because some of the information wasn't enough such as the the one in the home page. People said that we should include more information about the ingredients of our products and some more visuals, not only the video. </p>
